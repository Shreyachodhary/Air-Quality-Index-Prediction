# 🌍 Air Quality Index Prediction  

A machine learning project that predicts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** based on environmental parameters. The project helps in monitoring and analyzing air pollution levels for better decision-making and environmental control.  

---

## 📌 Overview  

This project uses machine learning models trained on air quality datasets to predict AQI categories (Good, Moderate, Poor, etc.). It demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment in a simple workflow.  

---

## 🛠️ Features  

- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, scaling, encoding).  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.  
- AQI prediction using ML models.  
- Model evaluation with accuracy and performance metrics.  
- Deployment-ready code.  

---

## 📊 Dataset  

The dataset includes environmental parameters such as:  
- PM2.5, PM10  
- NO2, SO2, CO, O3  
- Temperature, Humidity, etc.  

*(Dataset source: Public AQI datasets such as Kaggle/India AQI data)*

## 🚀 Tech Stack  

- **Python**  
- **NumPy, Pandas** (data handling)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (ML models)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 🔧 Usage  

Clone the repository and install dependencies:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shreyachodhary/Air-Quality-Index-Prediction.git
cd Air-Quality-Index-Prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ Future Improvements

Use deep learning for AQI forecasting.

Deploy the model as a web app (Streamlit/Flask).

Integrate real-time AQI data from APIs.
